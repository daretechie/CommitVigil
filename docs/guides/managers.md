# The Accountability Handbook: A Guide for Managers 👔

CommitGuard AI is a tool of empowerment, not surveillance. For a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) system to work, managers must know how to translate AI flags into professional leadership.

## 1. Interpreting the Flags
When CommitGuard flags an **"Ambiguity"** or a **"Truth Gap,"** it is a prompt for a conversation, not a citation for failure.

*   **Flag: "Ambiguous Commitment"**
    *   *AI Logic*: The user's words were too vague to extract a deadline.
    *   *Manager Action*: Don't scold. Instead, reply: *"Hey [Name], I saw your update. To help me clear any blockers, could you give me a rough target for when you'll have this in review?"*
    *   *Goal*: Precision, not pressure.

*   **Flag: "Truth Gap Detected"**
    *   *AI Logic*: Verbal claims don't match Git evidence.
    *   *Manager Action*: Assume there is a technical blocker. Ask: *"I noticed the repo hasn't updated since our chat. Are there any local environment issues or merge conflicts I should jump in on?"*
    *   *Goal*: Removing blockers, not investigating honesty.

## 2. Managing the "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL)
High-stakes interventions should never be 100% autonomous.

1.  **Review the Confidence Score**: If the AI has a `confidence_score` of 0.8 but flags a high risk, verify if the user's recent Slack messages were sarcastic or high-context.
2.  **Calibrate for Morale**: If the team has just finished a "Death March" (long sprint), manually increase the **Supportive Threshold** to allow for natural recovery.
3.  **Cross-Cultural Norms**: Ensure your specific team's "Directness Level" is reflected in the agent's tone settings.

## 3. Best Practices for Professionalism
*   **Public vs. Private**: CommitGuard monitors public channels, but follow-up interventions for **high-risk signals** should often be moved to a 1-on-1 private DM thread once the manager is alerted.
*   **Celebrate the Reliability**: When someone consistently hits 100% on their Reliability Score, use the report as a basis for formal recognition. Accountability is as much about **Praise** as it is about Progress.
