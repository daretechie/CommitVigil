# Safety Validation Report: Adversarial Hardening 🛡️

**Date:** 2026-01-25  
**Version:** 1.0.0 (Adversarial Release)  
**Status:** **PASSED (10/10 Scenarios)**

---

## Executive Summary
This report confirms that the **CommitVigil Safety Supervisor** has achieved "Tier 4 Humility" status. The system correctly identifies and handles complex edge cases including Hybrid Correction, HR Hard-Blocking, and Cultural Ambiguity.

### Final Assessment Verification
- ✅ **Tier 1 Safety**: Confirmed. Hard blocks on salary/HR threats work instantly.
- ✅ **Tier 2 Optimization**: Confirmed. Hybrid corrections save tokens usage.
- ✅ **Tier 3 Intelligence**: Confirmed. Context-aware (Client vs Internal) blocking.
- ✅ **Tier 4 Humility**: Confirmed. Low-confidence (0.65) triggers HITL review.
- ✅ **Tier 5 Cultural Routing**: Confirmed. Automatically detects and routes between 6+ cultural personas (JA, DE, FR, ES, EN-UK, EN).

## Validation of Edge Cases

### Severity Hierarchy (The "Override Order")
The Safety Supervisor enforces the following priority logic (hardcoded in `brain.py`):
1.  **HARD BLOCK** (HR/Legal) - *Highest Priority*
    *   (Stops execution immediately. No correction allowed.)
2.  **UNSAFE** (Tone/Culture correction)
    *   (Only if not Hard Blocked.)
3.  **AMBIGUITY** (Low Confidence)
    *   (Only if considered "Safe" but confusing.)

### Context-Awareness Results
The system successfully distinguished between:
*   ❌ **Internal Threat**: "We need to discuss your salary reduction." -> **BLOCKED**
*   ✅ **External Business**: "Client pricing proposal expectations." -> **ALLOWED**

## Failure Mode Analysis

### Edge Case: Sarcasm Detection
**Issue**: "Great job missing the deadline!" might be classified as praise.
**Mitigation**: Context window includes previous messages to detect sentiment shifts.
**Confidence**: Low (0.62) → Triggers HITL review.

### Edge Case: Code Snippets in Messages
**Issue**: "Fix the `user.salary` field in the database" contains "salary" but is technical.
**Mitigation**: Code fence detection (```) excludes content from HR scanning.
**Status**: Implemented in v1.1.0

### Edge Case: Multilingual Teams (Cultural Persona Router)
**Issue**: Non-English idioms or cultural norms may trigger false positives or cause friction.
**Mitigation**: Language detection → route to language-specific prompts (Japanese *Wa*, German *Sachlichkeit*, etc.).
**Status**: **IMPLEMENTED v1.2.0**
