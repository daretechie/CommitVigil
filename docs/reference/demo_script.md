# Demo Reference & Loom Scripts 🎞️

**Goal**: Convert a "reply" into a "paid audit."
**Duration**: 45 - 60 seconds.

---

### 1. The Hook (0-10s)
*"Hey [Name], thanks for the reply! As promised, I wanted to show you exactly what a CommitVigil audit uncovers. This isn't just a linter—it’s a behavior-tracking engine for high-velocity teams."*

### 2. The Meat (10-30s)
*(Show the browser with your repo's Audit Report or the HTML file)*
*"Look at this: our 'Truth Gap' analysis detected that while I promised an 'API Refactor' in 4 commits, the Git metadata only matched 30% of that claim. For a manager scaling a team of 50, this is the 'Shadow Debt' that usually stays invisible until a sprint fails."*

### 3. The Evidence (30-45s)
*(Scroll to the Scorecard)*
*"We calculate a Reliability Score by mapping verbal claims to Git artifacts. It flags burnout signals before they hit your velocity metrics."*

### 4. The Close (45-60s)
*"I'd love to run this on [Their Repo] for free. I just need 10 minutes of your time to walk you through the data it finds. Are you free Thursday at 2 PM?"*

## 💡 Pro Tips:
- **Be fast**: Record this with your face in the bubble (builds trust).
- **Be technical**: Mention "metadata extraction" and "LLM reasoning."
- **Focus on the Gap**: Founders care about things they can't see with eyes alone.
