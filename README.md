## 🎭 Dual-Persona Versatility

CommitVigil is a multi-agent system designed for high-stakes enforcement. It adapts its identity based on the operational environment:

### 1. The Behavioral Accountability Agent (Management)
**Headline:** *"Autonomous AI Agents for High-Stakes Accountability & Performance Enforcement"*
- **Problem:** Remote teams struggle with "commitment drift" and excuse-making.
- **Solution:** Proactively monitor chat promises.
- **Outcome:** Support burnout signals early; confront repeat deflection firmly.

### 2. The GitOps Accountability Engine (Engineering)
**Headline:** *"AI-Driven GitOps Accountability: Guaranteeing Commitment Follow-Through"*
- **Problem:** Small technical promises in commits/PRs (e.g., *"I'll fix this later"*) vanish into the noise.
- **Solution:** NLP-driven monitoring of source code level commitments.
- **Outcome:** 100% visibility into "soft commitments" made during the dev cycle.

### 🛡️ 2026 Enterprise Upgrade: Autonomous Adaptation
The system now includes self-evolving capabilities for global operations:
- **Autonomous Context Sensing**: Automatically detects **Industry** (e.g., Gaming, Biotech) and **Department** (e.g., R&D, Sales) from communication patterns.
- **Hierarchical Safety Enforcement**: Applies rules from specific (Department) to broad (Industry) to generic.
- **Stabilization Layer**: Autonomous rules start as **Unverified** and trigger Human-in-the-Loop review. Once confirmed, context is **Locked** for stability.
- **Cultural Persona Routing**: Automatically adapts tone for **Japanese (*Wa*)**, **German (*Sachlichkeit*)**, **French (Eloquence)**, **British English**, and **Spanish**.


## 🏗️ The Four-Stage Autonomous Pipeline
Every commitment—whether from Slack or a Git Commit—passes through a deterministic reasoning loop:

1.  **Excuse Detection (`ExcuseDetector`)**: Classifies sentiment (Legitimate vs. Deflection vs. Burnout).
2.  **Predictive Risk Assessment (`RiskScorer`)**: Quantifies failure probability based on historical reliability.
3.  **Language & Culture Router**: Identifies the primary language and selects the appropriate cultural persona.
4.  **Safety Supervisor (`Overwatch`)**: Audits final communications for HR/Legal ethics and **Industry-Specific Semantic Compliance**.

## 🛠️ Core Tech Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.12+)
- **LLM Orchestration**: Instructor + Pydantic (Deterministic JSON)
- **Quality**: Strict MyPy typing + Ruff
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL + Redis + ARQ
- **Observability**: Prometheus + Structlog
